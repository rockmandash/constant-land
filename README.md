### Now you can delete `constants.(js|ts)` in your projects!

# Introducing _constant-land_

## The last constants you ever need to declare.

___

### Highlights

1. Package is tree-shakable
1. Constants will use dynamic generation if possible, so the package is small
1. Every constants is postfix `as const` in TypeScript, so you can actually see the value when hovering in the value in your VSCode
1. All the constants are UPPER_CASE
1. Detailed JSDoc description when you hover on the constant
